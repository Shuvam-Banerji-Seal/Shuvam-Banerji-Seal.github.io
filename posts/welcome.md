# Welcome to the New Blog System!

This blog is now powered by **Markdown**, rendered dynamically on the client side. This allows for easier writing and better formatting.

## Features

### 1. Rich Text Formatting
You can use **bold**, *italic*, `inline code`, and more.

### 2. Syntax Highlighting
We use `Highlight.js` for beautiful code blocks:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print([fibonacci(i) for i in range(10)])
```

### 3. Mathematical Equations
We use `KaTeX` for high-quality math rendering.

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

Block math:
$$
\frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{9801} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}}
$$

### 4. Images

## Conclusion
This system makes it incredibly easy to share technical content involving code and math. Stay tuned for more updates!
