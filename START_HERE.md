### Step 2: Commit & Push
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Setup GitHub Pages deployment with automated workflow"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Watch It Deploy
Go to: https://github.com/Shuvam-Banerji-Seal/Shuvam-Banerji-Seal.github.io/actions

- Watch the workflow run

3. ✅ Installs dependencies
4. ✅ Builds with Vite (production mode)
5. ✅ Adds CNAME (if custom domain configured)
6. ✅ Deploys to `gh-pages` branch
7. ✅ Creates deployment summary

### Permissions Used
