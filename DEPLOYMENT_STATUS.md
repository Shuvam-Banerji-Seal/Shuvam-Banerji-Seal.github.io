## 🎯 Next Steps to Complete Deployment

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages (One-Time Setup)

1. **Go to your repository settings:**
   ```
   https://github.com/Shuvam-Banerji-Seal/Shuvam-Banerji-Seal.github.io/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Under "Build and deployment"
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** `gh-pages` (will be created automatically by the workflow)
   - **Folder:** `/ (root)`
   - Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Monitor the Deployment

1. **Go to Actions tab:**
   ```
   https://github.com/Shuvam-Banerji-Seal/Shuvam-Banerji-Seal.github.io/actions
   ```

2. **Watch the workflow:**
   - You should see "Deploy Portfolio to GitHub Pages" workflow running
   - Click on it to see real-time logs
   - Wait for it to complete (~1-2 minutes)

3. **Check for the green checkmark** ✅

### Step 3: Access Your Live Site

Once deployment completes, your site will be available at:

```
https://shuvam-banerji-seal.github.io
```

⏱️ **First deployment may take 2-3 minutes to go live**

## 🔍 What's Happening Now

The GitHub Actions workflow is:

1. ✅ Building your project with Vite
2. ✅ Optimizing assets for production
3. ✅ Creating the `gh-pages` branch
4. ✅ Deploying your site

You can watch this in real-time in the Actions tab!

## 📊 Deployment Status

### If GitHub Pages is not enabled yet:

You'll see the workflow complete successfully, but the site won't be live until you enable GitHub Pages in Settings (Step 1 above).

### Once GitHub Pages is enabled:

Every push to `main` will automatically:
- Build your site
- Deploy to `gh-pages` branch  
- Update your live site in ~30 seconds

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Workflow not showing in Actions tab?
- Wait a few seconds and refresh
- GitHub Actions may take a moment to start

### Build fails?
- Check the Actions logs for details
- Most common issue: dependencies or build errors
- Test locally: `npm run build`

### Site not loading after deployment?
- Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to update
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
- Check that source is set to `gh-pages` branch

### Need help?
- Check logs in Actions tab
- Read: `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
